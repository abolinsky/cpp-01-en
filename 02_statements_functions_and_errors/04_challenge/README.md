# Challenge 4

Create a `main.cpp` file in this directory, and copy this code into it.

The following program is supposed to find the maximum of two numbers entered by the user but it's not working correctly. Debug it and fix it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num1;
    int num2;
    int max;

    std::cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    std::cin >> num1 >> num2;

    if (num1 > num2) {
        max == num1;
    } else {
        max == num2;
    }

    std::cout << "Maximum is: " << max << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
