# Challenge 3

Create a `main.cpp` file in this directory, and complete the challenge there.

Write a C++ function `power` which takes two arguments - `base` and `exponent`. `exponent` has a default value of 2. `power` returns the result of `base` raised to the power `exponent`. Call this function with a base of 3 and exponent of 4 and print the result.
