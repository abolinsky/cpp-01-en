# Challenge 3

Create a C++ program that includes a header file `math_operations.h` which contains function declarations for basic mathematical operations (`addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, and `division`) in a namespace `MathOps`. Implement these functions in a separate file `math_operations.cpp`. Use these functions in a main program file `main.cpp`. The program should prompt the user for two numbers and the operation to be performed, then display the result.

### Example 1

input:

```
Enter a calculation: 4 / 5
```

output:

```
Result: 0.8
```

### Example 2

input:

```
Enter a calculation: 24 - 6
```

output:

```
Result: 18
```
