# Challenge 1

Create a `main.cpp` file in this directory, and copy this code into it.

Given an integer variable `x`, write a code snippet to print its memory address. Then, create an integer pointer `p` that points to the address of `x`, and print the value stored at the address pointed to by `p`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 42;

    // TODO
}
```
