# Challenge 3

Create a `main.cpp` file in this directory, and copy this code into it.

Create a function `double_elements` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as its argument and returns a new `std::vector<int>` with each element doubled. Then, use a range-based for loop to print the elements of both the original and the new vector.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// TODO

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // TODO
}
```
